                    <p>
                      Hi, I'm Liah Tauber, a teacher on a career transformation journey toward becoming a full-stack developer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I recently completed a comprehensive Full-Stack Developer JavaScript bootcamp, where I gained proficiency in various technologies including JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I have a strong passion for coding and enjoy the challenges that come with it. As an educator, I have developed excellent communication skills and the ability to explain complex concepts in a simple and engaging manner. I love sharing my knowledge and helping others learn and grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I am excited to continue my growth as a full-stack developer and contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact. Please explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on. Feel free to get in touch with me to discuss collaboration or any other opportunities!
                    </p>
